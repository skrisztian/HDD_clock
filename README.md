#  HDD Clock Project
## FedEx Day Project

We are creating our individulized HDD Clock complex, made out of four used hard disk drivers and AVR AtMega168PB boards. The plates rotating in the HDD are custom cut.

With this project we participate on the FedEx Day.
We are students of Green Fox Academy, a coding school in Budapest.
